                Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds that inhabit the Southern Hemisphere. 
                Penguins can weigh anywhere between 2-88 pounds and live up to 15-20 years. 
                Depending on the species, a Penguin's main diet consists of various krill, squids, and fishes.
                Although penguins can't fly, their flippers and webbed feet allow them to swim underwater with ease.
